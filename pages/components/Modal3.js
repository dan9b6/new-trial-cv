              My first day at school was at Lilliput Primary School. Who could

              the world of tech.

              I went to my first ever football match - Arsenal vs Southampton.
              Since my trip to this beautiful stadium, being an Arsenal fan has
              definitely become more and more painful over the years. I hope
              that being a fan of this club won't be a dealbreaker!

              My first job was landed. I became a paperboy! Monday to Saturday
              at 6:30am I would make my way down to my local newsagents to
              collect my round and get underway. Wasn't the dream role - but
              that Â£25 a week went a long way back then.

              I was (and still am) obsessed with football. Fortunately, I had
              the opportunity to play for Yeovil FC Academy. During this time I
              played against a number of academy teams at the highest level.
              However, I didn't quite make the cut.

              I had finished my GCSE's! I managed to get 11 GCSE's all A-C -
              including an A in Maths, Biology and P.E. So to celebrate my
              exams, me and a few friends went to Cardiff for the Olympic Games
              to watch GB take on South Korea. Unfortunately they lost 5-4 on
              penalties.

              I began my first job in Educational Sales at The Training Room.
              This was my first exposure to the world of tech. Originallly I
              began selling Personal Training courses. However, I then moved
              into selling Software & Web Development training courses. Whilst
              working at The Training Room I worked with a team of Sales
              Executives trying to help people change their career's and enter
              into the world of IT. It was during this time that I started to
              look into these areas myself and my interest in the sector began
              to increase.

              At the start of 2019, I decided to go travelling in Thailand. It
              was a truly incredible experience and during my time I visited
              many islands, met people from around the world, many adventure
              days and of course - went to many bars. However, during my time in
              Asia, it gave me a real chance to reflect on what I wanted to do
              when I got back home - which is when I started looking into roles
              in tech.

              I graduated as a Web Developer through Ironhack Tech Bootcamp -
              Lisbon. During the course I covered a number of technologies and
              languages. Such as:
            </p>
            <ul className="text-white ">
              <li>HTML</li>
              <li>CSS / SASS</li>
              <li>Javascript</li>
              <li>React JS</li>
              <li>Node JS / Express</li>
              <li>Next JS</li>
              <li>Bootstrap</li>
              <li>and many other skills which you can find on this link.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This whole experience was a real eye-opener for me. I never
              thought it would be possible to learn as much as I did during this
              bootcamp and leave with three fully functional projects.
